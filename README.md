## Welcome to my personal project!

If you would like to try my game, you just need to follow these three very simple steps:

1. Download my code to your local environment.
2. Find the index.html file and open it use your browser.
3. Open the browser's developer mode and convert the browser to mobile mode.

If the page is a little bit weird, please do the final step (I promise!), fresh your browser.
(I know the steps may a little bit annoying, I will fix it as soon as possible.)

That's it, you made it! You can play my game now!

One thing I need to mention is that the database I used is not cloud database, so some functionalities may not work very well (such as ranking function). I am sorry about that and I will optimise it and other annoying bugs that may exist as soon as possible once I am free.

Anyway, thanks for playing and I hope you enjoy!

## Cheers!
